/**
 * A <code>Converter</code> for data types.
 * <p>
 * A general data type conversion interface that can be provided to jOOQ at
 * various places in order to perform custom data type conversion. Conversion is
 * directed, this means that the <code>Converter</code> is used
 * <ul>
 * <li>to load database types converting them to user types "FROM" the database.
 * Hence, {@link #fromType()} is the type as defined in the database.</li>
 * <li>to store user types converting them to database types "TO" the database.
 * Hence, {@link #toType()} is the user-defined type</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note: In order to avoid unwanted side-effects, it is highly recommended (yet
 * not required) for {@link #from(Object)} and {@link #to(Object)} to be
 * <strong>reciprocal</strong>. The two methods are reciprocal, if for all
 * <code>X and Y</code>, it can be said that
 * <ul>
 * <li>if <code>Y.equals(converter.from(X))</code>, then
 * <code>X.equals(converter.to(Y))</code>.</li>
 * <li>
 * <code>X.equals(converter.from(converter.to(X)))</code></li>
 * <li><code>X.equals(converter.to(converter.from(X)))</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, it is recommended (yet not required) that
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>converter.from(null) == null</code></li>
 * <li><code>converter.to(null) == null</code></li>
 * </ul>
