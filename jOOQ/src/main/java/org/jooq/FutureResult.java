/**
 * Fetch results asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * This type wraps fetching of records in a {@link java.util.concurrent.Future},
 * such that you can access the actual records at a future instant. This is
 * especially useful when
 * <ul>
 * <li>You want to load heavy data in the background, for instance when the user
 * logs in and accesses a pre-calculated dashboard screen, before they access
 * the heavy data.</li>
 * <li>You want to parallelise several independent OLAP queries before merging
 * all data into a single report</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @deprecated - 3.2.0 - [#2581] - This type will be removed in jOOQ 4.0
