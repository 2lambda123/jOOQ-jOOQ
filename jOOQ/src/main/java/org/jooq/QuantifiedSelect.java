 * A participant of a quantified comparison predicate

 * A <code>QuantifiedSelect</code> models the right hand side of a quantified
 * comparison predicate. Examples of such predicates:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ANY (SELECT 1 FROM DUAL)</code></li>
 * <li><code>ALL (SELECT 1 FROM DUAL)</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * These predicates can be used exclusively with methods, such as {@link Field}
