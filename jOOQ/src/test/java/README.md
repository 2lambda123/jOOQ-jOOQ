How do we ensure quality?
=========================

These are some of jOOQ's unit tests that we ship also with the jOOQ Open Source edition. However,
they do not constitute a very important part of jOOQ's Quality Assurance. We run a suite of 500+
integration tests against all 17 currently supported RDBMS, totalling in more than 17 x 10'000 queries
being executed in total.

We do not publish these integration tests with the Open Source edition of jOOQ as this is a service
we're currently offering only to paying customers. Rest assured, though, that also the jOOQ Open Source
Edition is fully covered by our high quality standards.
