 * A generator strategy that prefixes class names with a letter <code>J</code>.

 * An example variant of the default naming strategy
 * {@link DefaultGeneratorStrategy} adding the prefix 'J' to generated class

 * <p>
 * This strategy is to be understood as a working example, not part of the code
 * generation library. It may be modified / adapted in the future. Use at your
 * own risk.
